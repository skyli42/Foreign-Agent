Since your last mission was such a success, we've decided to train you to deal with more advanced defenses.
[title=IntroTalkEnd]

[title=BcellTalkStart]
This is a <color=yellow><b>B-cell!</b></color> B-cells are harmless as is, but touch the B-cell now and see what happens. 
[title=BcellTalkEnd]

[title=plasmaSpawnStart]
The B-cell differentiated into a <color=#00ffffff><b>plasma cell!</b></color> The plasma cell secretes <b>antibodies</b> that will roam the area randomly. 
Be careful, if an antibody attaches to you it will become easier for macrophages to detect you!
Infect the cell in front of you to move onto the next stage of training.
[title=plasmaSpawnEnd]

[title=companionStart]
When a macrophage engulfs a virus, a chain of events is triggered.
The macrophage in front of you is locked in place so don't worry about it chasing you. 
Press space to send out your companion virus to see what happens.
[title=companionEnd]

[title=THelperStart]
<color=#ff00ffff><b>T-Helper</b></color> cells have been activated after the virus was engulfed by the macrophage!
T-Helper cells stimulate all B-cells to differentiate into Plasma Cells!
Run past the immobile macrophage and infect the final cell to complete your training.
[title=THelperEnd]

[title=deathStart]
I don't know how, but you managed to die from the completely stationary macrophage. Try not to do it again.
[title=deathEnd]

[title=endLevelStart]
Now that we've taught you about B cells, let's see how you fare in a more realistic scenario.
