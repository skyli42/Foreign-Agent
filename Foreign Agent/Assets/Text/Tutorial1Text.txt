This is a human cell. Your goal is to infect and replicate within all cells in the area. 
To infect, walk inside the cell and wait until the infection is complete.

[title=infectionSuccessStart]
You successfully infected this cell. One of the new viruses has decided to join you as a companion!

[title=macrophageInstructionStart]
This is a <color=green><b>MACROPHAGE</b></color>. 
Macrophages protect the body from foreign invaders like ourselves, and will engulf any virus that they come close to, so be careful!
However, you'll be glad to know that they <b>cannot</b> see you while you are infecting a cell!
[title=macrophageInstructionEnd]

[title=deathStart]
You were engulfed by the macrophage! Since this is a training simulation, I've reset you right back here and given your companion back. But you wont be so lucky during the real invasion.
[title=deathEnd]

[title=endLevelStart]
Congratulations! You've successfully completed your first infection.
