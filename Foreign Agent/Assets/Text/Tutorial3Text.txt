For our last basic training session, I will introduce you to <color=green><b>Killer T-cells</b></color>.
These cells will not pose any danger to you as you roam the level...
but when you begin replication the killer T-cells will bind to the human cell to destroy it and any viruses replicating within it before the cell becomes infected. 
Try to replicate within the cell now.

As you can see, the killer T-cell was successful in destroying the cell before you could infect it. 
In a real mission, you and the cell would both be destroyed and the mission would be over.
The T-cell will now patrol further away from the cell. You will have to time your infection correctly to infect the cell before the killer T-cell arrives.

Note that when T-helper cells are activated, Killer T-cells will get a boost in awareness and speed so be careful!
